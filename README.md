# Modeling-Analysis based on Calorical Values 

Welcome to our Data Science 80 (DSC80) project at UC San Diego, where we delve into the captivating realm of culinary exploration. Our project centers around unraveling the intricate relationship between the caloric content of recipes and their corresponding average ratings. This research is a continuous of our previous project, "Significant relations with ratings of recipes". This research unfolds across four distinct sections: *Framing the Problem*, *Baseline Model*, *Final Model* and *Fairness Analysis*.
